                <p class="p2">
                    I went to high school in Colegio San Agustin 
                    - Makati, then attended Senior High School 
                    (SHS) in De La Salle University - Manila. I 
                    entered De La Salle University - Manila in 
                    2020 under BS Civil Engineering, but then 
                    shifted to BS Interactive Entertainment with 
                    specialization in Game Design. Although, I 
                    had only stayed in BS Interactive Entertainment 
                    for 1 year and shifted once again to BS Computer 
                    Science with specialization in Computer Science. 
                    Iâ€™m currently in my 2nd year in Computer Science.

                <p class="p2">
                    Cats are my favorite animal. In my SHS I was part of the 
                    DLSU - PUSA organization. I would feed the cats after class 
                    from 5pm - 7pm. At that time there were about 100+ cats and I 
                    had memorized each and every one of their names. I also have 
                    adopted cats of my own; my cats are named Momo (Female) and 
                    Booper (Male). They are both 2 years old.
